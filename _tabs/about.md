My name is Sam Matthews. I am a Computer Science Student and frequently post about code, infrastructure, homelab, gaming, and building systems. I also very interested in privacy and security.


Having a personal interest in cybersecurity, I really enjoy listening to podcasts on the subject, such as the weekly [‘Surveillance Report’](https://www.youtube.com/SurveillanceReport) podcast keeping me updated on the latest cyber attacks and vulnerabilities. They also explore privacy and I enjoy working out how to cover my tracks, and how to protect our digital lives from Big Tech, such as the FAANGs, through digital minimalism. Additionally, I find ethical hacking intriguing and have been watching YouTube videos by John Hammond and other creators, through videos on latest vulnerabilities and exploits which are always evolving.
